# Operational Progress & Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## Current Phase & Milestone
- **Current Milestone**: Phase 0: Project Inception, Architectural Documentation & Scaffolding
- **Overall Status**: Scaffolding initialized, ready for Phase 1.1 implementation.

---

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyze LocalSend protocol v2.2 specification (`/g/localsend.protocol`).
- [x] Analyze LocalSend core Rust implementation (`/g/localsend/packages/core`).
- [x] Evaluate Multicast UDP vs. mDNS (DNS-SD) tradeoffs and formulate dual-engine discovery design.
- [x] Create comprehensive system architecture document ([`ARCHITECTURE.md`](file:///f/lanflare/ARCHITECTURE.md)).
- [x] Create granular phased development roadmap with verification commands ([`ROADMAP.md`](file:///f/lanflare/ROADMAP.md)).
- [x] Initialize operational progress tracker ([`PROGRESS.md`](file:///f/lanflare/PROGRESS.md)).
- [x] Initialize Cargo workspace and crate scaffolding passing `cargo check`.

## Architecture Decisions & Invariants (ADRs)

- **ADR-001: Cargo Workspace Structure**
  - *Context*: We need a reusable core library for both CLI and GUI, plus shared protocol definitions.
  - *Decision*: Adopt a multi-crate workspace: `lanflare-proto` (DTOs), `lanflare-core` (network, crypto, storage), `lanflare-cli` (binary), and `lanflare-desktop` (Tauri).
  - *Consequences*: Clean separation of concerns; enables independent testing and lean CLI deployment without GUI bloat.

- **ADR-002: Dual-Engine Discovery (LocalSend Multicast + Modern mDNS)**
  - *Context*: LocalSend uses UDP multicast (`224.0.0.167:53317`), which is often dropped on enterprise and guest networks. mDNS (`224.0.0.251:5353`) is widely reflected and supported by OS standard services.
  - *Decision*: Provide both discovery engines concurrently. LocalSend Multicast provides backward compatibility with official LocalSend apps, while mDNS provides zero-configuration discovery for LanFlare-native peers. Discovered peers are deduplicated by TLS certificate SHA-256 fingerprint.

- **ADR-003: Mutual TLS with Fingerprint Pinning (mTLS)**
  - *Context*: Local network peers are ad-hoc without public certificate authority (CA) hierarchies.
  - *Decision*: Generate self-signed certificates using `rcgen`. Authentication relies on pinning and verifying the SHA-256 fingerprint of the remote certificate against the fingerprint advertised during discovery or handshake.

- **ADR-004: Direct Streaming File Transfers with Incremental SHA-256**
  - *Context*: File sharing involves arbitrary sizes (from small photos to multi-gigabyte video or backup archives).
  - *Decision*: Files must stream directly from the HTTP socket to temporary disk storage (`.lanflare-part`) via buffered async streams. Compute SHA-256 concurrently during streaming and atomically rename to destination path only upon verification match. Never buffer complete files in RAM.

- **ADR-005: Strict Path Traversal Defense**
  - *Context*: Remote peers specify `fileName` in `prepare-upload`.
  - *Decision*: Sanitize all received filenames by extracting strictly the basename, stripping illegal path characters and path separators (`/`, `\`, null bytes, control codes), and confining outputs strictly within the configured download directory.

## Known Debt & Blockers
- *None at present (scaffolding stage).*

## Next Session Target
- **Target**: **Phase 1.1: Protocol DTOs & Serialization (`lanflare-proto`)**
- **Action Items**:
  1. Populate `lanflare-proto/src/discovery.rs` and `lanflare-proto/src/transfer.rs` with LocalSend v2.2 JSON models.
  2. Implement unit tests verifying serialization and deserialization against LocalSend specification test vectors.
  3. Verify with `cargo test -p lanflare-proto`.
